            <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Akshita<br /></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            I am a recent Master's graduate (May 2020) in <a href="{{ page.cics }}">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="{{ page.umass }}">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Technology from <a href="{{ page.daiict }}">Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT)</a>, India in 2015.

            My interests include machine learning and deep learning, and I am particularly keen to explore their applications to natural language processing and humanities. I am currently working with Prof. Mohit Iyyer on interpreting what neural models learn about stylistic content in fictional texts. In Fall 2019, I collaborated with Prof. Eric Poehler from UMass Classics department to automate dataset construction and build an interface to explore art and architecture of Pompeii (ancient Roman city). In Summer 2019, I worked as a Machine Learning Intern at <a href="{{ page.cci }}">Cerebellum Capital</a>. In Spring 2019, I collaborated with <a href="{{ page.scripps }}">Scripps Research</a> to improve the quality of crowd-sourced annotations in biomedical text using graphical models, to improve named entity recognition. My prior work at <a href="{{ page.infocusp }}">InFoCusp</a> has been to develop a data science platform for enabling R&D as well as productization of financial datasets and models.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy <a href="{{ site.goodreads }}">reading</a> novels, <a href="{{ site.wordpress }}">writing</a> (especially poetry), and practising Yoga.
